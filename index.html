	  <span class="bgtext">Clara Vankerschaver graduated as a textile
designer in 2010 at KASK &ndash; School of Arts, Ghent, where she is currently
working as a doctoral researcher on the project <em>Textile as a vessel for
tacit knowledge</em>.  In this project various craft strategies are explored in
search of effective transmission of tacit knowledge. Her work emerges from a
persistent inquiry into contemporary textile design practice. In particular,
there is a focus on communal and constitutive aspects of design to go beyond
the conventional development and production of fabrics, arriving at a more
versatile understanding of the forces that generate design.</span></p>
